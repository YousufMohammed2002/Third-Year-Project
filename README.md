### Completed 2nd May 2023

This repository contains the report and code which I complted for my third year project at the University of Warwick as a MSci Data Science Student.

The code is in the form of an RMarkdown file and a Netica file (Bayesian Network).

The code and report are free to download and view. 

### Abstract 

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the lives of almost everyone across the
globe, due to lockdowns and isolation. People have had to adapt to new lifestyle changes affecting people not
just physically but psychologically as well. This report intends to understand whether the COVID-19 pandemic
negatively impacted UK university studentsâ€™ mental health and which groups of people were affected to a lesser
or greater extent regarding their mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods: Data sets were cleaned and visualised in R and RStudio. Modelling was done using linear regression
models using p-value hypothesis testing at a 5% significance level. For one data set a Bayesian network was
created and tested.

Results: For UK University students, mental health was worse in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019 (p-values
of 0.0123 and 0.0047 respectively), but this is no different to scores in 2017 (p-value of 0.593). In Australia,
those aged 18-39 had the worst mental health out of all age groups, women had worse mental health compared
to men, and those whose working hours changed a lot also had worse mental health compared to those who
had no change in working hours.
